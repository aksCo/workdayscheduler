# A WorkDay Scheduler

## Description 
What? 
A project that launches a WorkDay Scheduler. 

Functionality:

When you scroll down, you will be presented with time blocks for the standard business hours - 9am to 5pm.

Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

When you click into a time block, you can enter an event.

When you click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage. 

When you refresh the page, the saved events persist.

Why? 
To enable the user to key in tasks for the regular working hours 
from 9am to 5pm. 

How? Using JavaScript including Moments.js, HTML and CSS
